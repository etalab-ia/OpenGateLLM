class WorkingContext:
    """
    When RabbitMQ is enabled, the user request does not travel the API's layers in a classical way:
      the request is sent through the queue, and get caught by consumers, using callback architectures.
    It would be way too complex, rigid and inefficient to pass the request itself through RabbitMQ,  so it is
      represented as a unique uuid4. But once the request is about to get executed, the API needs its actual content
      and context, specifically the handler the user gave.
    To reconcile both sides (a simple message vs a complex and abstract request), the user adds its handler and
      its (thread) context to a register, managed by the objects that, on the other hand, consume a queue
      (ModelRouter and ModelClient). This way, when the consumer callback is called, it gets request content
      through this inner register.

    This class gathers both the context and the content of the user's request.
